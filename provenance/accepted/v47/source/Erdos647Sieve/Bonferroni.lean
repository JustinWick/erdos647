Algebraic weighted Bonferroni component.
STATUS: PATCHED AFTER USER COMPILER FEEDBACK; NOT RECOMPILED HERE.
No theorem in this file is being reported as kernel-verified.

The recursive definitions are ordinary finite algebra. `truncation_eq_sum`
connects the recurrence to the alternating elementary-symmetric sum. The
remaining sieve work must connect the list coefficients to prime subsets.
